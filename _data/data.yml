projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      Worked on the following projects either individually or as a team, harnessing skills as a
      Data Analyst; areas of interest includes: recommendation system, customer behavior study,
      computer vision, and data visualization (but not limited to).    
    assignments:
      - title: Personalized Shopping Recommender (PSR)
        link: "//github.com/damengjin/Personalized-Shopping-Recommender"
        tagline: "The PSR provided personalized recommendations for both existing and new users 
        (solved cold start problem) with SVDpp and K-nn family algorithms; the recommender was able
        to predict top recommended items and top similar users for the targeting user, then deliver
        the output to the back-end SaaS web application; besides the recommender, a front end web application 
        was also developed for the SaaS project;"

      - title: Image Classification model on Movie Posters
        link: "//github.com/damengjin/Image_Classification_Movie_posters"
        tagline: "Built a classification model on 16,000 movie posters, adopting image augmentation
        to prevent overfitting, various neural-networks, and transfer learning with pretrained 
        VGG-16 and inception models to boost up training speed; explored and visualized the intermediate 
        layers, and eventually visualized the discriminative region using class activation maps on
        movie posters; some insights were gained despite the correlation between poster and comment
        was not strong enough (62% accuracy);"

      - title: Patron Clustering and Churn Prediction
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Performed clustering on patron base, provided personalized recommendation on retail 
        and F&B campaign offers; Tailored offers saw an increased redemption rate by 39% YoY, and retail 
        revenue was up by 32% YoY; Patron retail trip cycles and gaming behavior were studied, a churn 
        prediction model (logit regression and random forest) was built afterwards to decide whether more 
        intense offers were required to prevent the patron from churning; test group shows 47% less churn 
        rate then the control group;"

      - title: Real-time Alert System
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Queried the inhouse data using sophisticated SQL every 5 minutes using stored procedures, 
        to spot any patrons who hadn’t been assigned a host from operation team yet had a qualified inhouse 
        play with high average bet or win/loss amount; Alerts would be sent to the hosts automatically, 
        enabling them to motivate alerted patrons for future play; 80% of these alerted patron showed 
        incremental play afterwards, and 65% of them reached higher membership tier, contributing 23% more 
        gaming revenue;"

      - title: Patron On-floor Live Dashboard
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Queried and updated the inhouse data directly then fed into Tableau server to create a 
        dashboard that shows the real-time location of the patron over the floor map; provided detailed 
        gaming metrics (played duration, average bet, win-loss) of the patron to help operation understand 
        patron behavior and approach the patron on time while they are still inside Casino;"
